# OSDF Documentation

This website contains guides for interacting with a custom namespace in the OSDF.

??? info "Are you an OSPool user?"

    If you are an OSPool user, you already have access to an OSDF origin on your OSPool Access Point.
    To learn how to use this origin on the OSPool, see the [OSPool guide](https://portal.osg-htc.org/documentation/htc_workloads/managing_data/osdf/).
